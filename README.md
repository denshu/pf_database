# pf_database
"pf" stands for Project FLIPNOTIK, a game I tried making in RPG Maker XP between 2009 and 2013. 

Why did I make a database for an unfinished game? Because I can, basically.

This website was developed from scratch using HTML with SVG animations, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP, MySQL, and the Bootstrap framework for a responsive, mobile-friendly design. I spent 4 days working on it.
